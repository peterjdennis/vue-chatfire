Similar to `style-loader`, you can chain it after `css-loader` to dynamically inject CSS into the document as style tags. However, since this is included as a dependency and used by default in `vue-loader`, in most cases you don't need to configure this loader yourself.\r\n\r\n### Differences from `style-loader`\r\n\r\n#### Server-Side Rendering Support\r\n\r\nWhen bundling with `target: 'node'`, the styles in all rendered components are collected and exposed on the Vue render context object as `context.styles`, which you can simply inline into your markup's `<head>`. If you are building a Vue SSR app, you probably should use this loader for CSS imported from JavaScript files too.\r\n\r\n#### Misc\r\n\r\n- Does not support url mode and reference counting mode. Also removed `singleton` and `insertAt` query options. It always automatically pick the style insertion mechanism that makes most sense. If you need these capabilities you should probably use the original `style-loader` instead.\r\n\r\n- Fixed the issue that root-relative URLs are interpreted against chrome:// urls and make source map URLs work for injected `<style>` tags in Chrome.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nMIT\r\n","maintainers":[{"name":"yyx990803","email":"yyx990803@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-01-31T02:47:11.401Z","created":"2016-01-05T19:12:04.432Z","1.0.0":"2016-01-05T19:12:04.432Z","2.0.0":"2017-01-31T02:47:11.401Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue-style-loader#readme","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+ssh://git@github.com/vuejs/vue-style-loader.git"},"author":{"name":"Evan You"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue-style-loader/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"588ffaaf-111d\"","_lastModified":"Tue, 31 Jan 2017 02:47:11 GMT"}
